Add CogVLM: State-of-the-Art Visual Language Foundation Model with Deep Fusion
## CogVLM: Visual Expert Model with Deep Fusion

### Overview
CogVLM represents a paradigm shift in visual language models by implementing a deep fusion approach through a trainable visual expert module in attention and FFN layers, moving beyond traditional shallow alignment methods. Unlike previous approaches that simply map image features into the language model's input space, CogVLM maintains full NLP task performance while achieving state-of-the-art results across 17 classic cross-modal benchmarks.

### Technical Innovation
CogVLM bridges the gap between frozen pretrained language models and image encoders through:
- Trainable visual expert module integration
- Deep fusion of vision-language features
- Preserved NLP task performance
- Scalable architecture (17B parameters)

### Benchmark Performance
Achieves SOTA results across multiple categories:
1. Image Captioning:
   - NoCaps
   - Flicker30k
2. Visual Question Answering:
   - OKVQA
   - TextVQA
   - OCRVQA
   - ScienceQA
3. LVLM Benchmarks:
   - MMVet
   - MMBench
   - SEED-Bench
   - LLaVABench
   - POPE
   - MMMU
   - MathVista
4. Visual Grounding:
   - RefCOCO
   - RefCOCO+
   - RefCOCOg
   - Visual7W

### Integration Considerations
The model's architecture makes it particularly suitable for A2A applications requiring:
- Complex visual reasoning
- Multi-task capabilities
- Robust cross-modal understanding
- Maintained language processing abilities

### Future Impact
As an open-source project, CogVLM provides a solid foundation for future multimodal research, particularly in areas such as:
- SFT alignment optimization
- RLHF implementation
- Anti-hallucination techniques
- Multi-modal system integration
