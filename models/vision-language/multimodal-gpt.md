## Technical Significance
MultiModal-GPT introduces a revolutionary approach to vision-language interaction by implementing a dynamic context management system that maintains both visual and conversational history. The model's novel attention mechanism intelligently weighs historical dialogue turns against visual features, enabling more coherent and context-aware multimodal conversations.

## Implementation Details
```python
class MultiModalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads=8):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.visual_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(dim, num_heads)
        self.dialogue_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(dim, num_heads)
        self.context_mixer = nn.Linear(dim * 2, dim)
        
    def forward(self, visual_features, dialogue_history, current_query):
        # Process visual context
        visual_attn = self.visual_attention(
            current_query, 
            visual_features, 
            visual_features
        )
        
        # Process dialogue context
        dialogue_attn = self.dialogue_attention(
            current_query,
            dialogue_history,
            dialogue_history
        )
        
        # Combine contexts dynamically
        combined_context = self.context_mixer(
            torch.cat([visual_attn, dialogue_attn], dim=-1)
        )
        
        return combined_context
