**Paper:** [GPT4ROI: Instruction Tuning Large Language Models with Region-of-Interest Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09507)  
**Code:** [Official Implementation](https://github.com/jshilong/GPT4RoI)  
**Demo:** Available in official repository

GPT4ROI represents a breakthrough in region-based visual understanding by introducing spatial instruction tuning that enables precise interactions with specific image regions. Its significance lies in achieving near-human performance (81.6%) on Visual Commonsense Reasoning, surpassing previous models by 6%. The model uniquely combines natural language processing with region-of-interest features, allowing users to interact through both text and bounding box inputs.

**Key Features:**
- Spatial instruction tuning with region feature integration
- Interactive region selection through text or bounding boxes
- Comprehensive attribute understanding (color, shape, material, action)
- Multi-region reasoning capabilities
- End-to-end architecture without separate region proposal networks

**Implementation Example:**
```python
# Basic usage of GPT4ROI
from gpt4roi import GPT4ROI, RegionProcessor

# Initialize model
model = GPT4ROI.from_pretrained("gpt4roi-base")

# Process image and region
image = load_image("example.jpg")
region = RegionProcessor.get_bbox([x1, y1, x2, y2])

# Generate response for specific region
response = model.generate(
    image=image,
    region=region,
    prompt="Describe the object in this region"
)
